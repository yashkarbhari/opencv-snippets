OpenCV snippets
Random OpenCV code snippets which help while using opencv.

01.py : Read and write the image and use the 'esc' key to destroy all the windows and 's' key to save the image and make a copy of that image in the current folder.

02.py : For video capture from your default PC camera.

03.py : Changing BGR colour format to gray.

04.py : Video reading and saving using the default camera.

05.py : Inserting line, arrowedLine, rectangle, circle, putText in the image.

06.py : making a image using numpy zeros.

07.py : Change the dimensions of the video frame.

08.py : __Adding datetime__ to the captured video.

09.py : Show the coordinates on the image when the left mouse button is clicked on the image.

10.py : When we right click on the image, we will get the colour of the image in the BGR format, and when we left click on the image we will get the coordinates of the image.

11.py : This will make a circle at a point you will left click and then join the 1st and the 2nd points with a line and so on.

12.py : Adding two images from __cv2.add()__.

13.py : Using different types of __bitwise operators__.

14.py : __Creating a Trackebar__ to change the colour of the image using B, G, R channel trackbars.

15.py : Creating a trackbar with mask on the video captured and masks the video with the described HSV given in the trackbar.

16.py : __Simple thresholding__(a segmentation technique) on Images using OpenCV.

17.py : __Adaptive thresholding__(threshold is calculated for local region and not global), so there will be different regions with different thresholding.

18.py : __Morpholgical Transformations__(morpholiogical transformations are some simple operations based on the image shape).

19.py : Smoothing(or Blurring), it is used to remove noise in the images.
